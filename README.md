# GradSchoolProjects
A place where I can house the different types of projects that I worked on while pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics at the University of Nebraska.

This will include technical projects written in SQL and R, as well as papers and case studies.

I will attempt to document my learning process over time as well, but I'm still trying to get better at commenting on my code.
